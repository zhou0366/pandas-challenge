Analysis

Scores by Grade
    Between the different grade levels for each school, average scores and passing rates appear similar across all four grade levels.

Scores by School Spending
    School spending appears to have an inverse effect on performance. In both math and reading, the average scores and passing rates decrease as spending bins increase. I would typically expect higher spending per student would lead to the school showing overall scores and passing rates. The results go completely against this expectations so I would examine how that money is being spent.

Scores by School Size
    Small and medium schools both had similar performance levels across the board. However, large schools fell behind small and medium schools in all categories. Large schools especially appear to have low math passing percentages being almost 13% points lower than reading. This also will decrease the overall passing rate in large schools. Schools under 2000 students show similar passing rates between math and reading. I would raise some concerns over math courses in large schools over 2000 students.

Scores by School Type
    When comparing charter and district schools, the results I saw was that students in charter schools achieved higher average scores in all categories and achieved higher passing rates in all categories. District schools especially appear to have low math passing percentages. Students in district schools show 14% points lower in math than in reading. This also will decrease the overall passing rate for charter schools. Charter school students show similar passing rates between math and reading. I would raise some concerns over math courses in district schools.

To summarize, it would appear that factors leading towards higher scores and passing rates are:
    -Less spending per student
    -Having under 2000 students (a small or medium school)
    -Being a charter school
